## Time Series analysis

Short-term temperature forecast.

For this project weather data for Berlin was taken from  www.ecad.eu. First the data were extracted and cleaned and different plooting approaches were implemented so as to inspect the different components of a times series and especially trend and seasonality.
 To model the time dependence of the remainder an AR model was builted. After i comparaed the statistical outputs and tested the remainder for stationarity.
 At the end i added lags and trained the model to predict short-time forecasts.
